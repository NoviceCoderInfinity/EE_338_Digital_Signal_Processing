\textbf{Problem:}
If there are 3 sequences such that,

\[
x[n] = x_1[n] \ast x_2[n]
\]

with each having a Z-transform named \( X(Z) \), \( X_1(Z) \), and \( X_2(Z) \) with regions of convergence \( R \), \( R_1 \), \( R_2 \) respectively.

We have:

\[
X(Z) = X_1(Z) \cdot X_2(Z)
\]

With this provided, can we say that \( R \subseteq (R_1 \cap R_2) \), or can \( R \) (region of convergence of \( X(Z) \)) extend beyond the intersection of \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \)?
